## tomboy-to-joplin-raw

Converts Tomboy notes to Joplin Markdown in Joplin's "RAW" format.
Call with no arguments. It will find your Tomboy notes using XDG, and export them to a new folder "Joplin-RAW" in the current directory.
Tries to do good job with formatting, links, notebooks, etc.

Tested with Tomboy 1.15.9 and Joplin 1.0.175 on Linux; probably won't work on Windows.
